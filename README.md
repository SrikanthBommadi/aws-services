"My name is Bommadi Srikanth. I'm a DevOps Engineer with over five years of hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, automation, and CI/CD pipeline development. Currently, I work at Air Canada, where I’ve led efforts to improve infrastructure automation, reduce deployment times, and enhance system reliability using tools like Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and AWS.

I specialize in Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, GitOps with ArgoCD, and serverless technologies. I've successfully implemented solutions that reduced manual effort by over 70% and downtime by 15%.

I'm passionate about scalable cloud solutions, automation, and continuous improvement, and I'm now looking for an opportunity to bring my expertise to a new environment where I can continue to innovate and grow."

roles and responsibilites

Automating infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, including reusable modules for AWS.
Managing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, integrating tools like SonarQube for code quality.
Handling containerization using Docker and orchestrating microservices using Kubernetes on EKS, with Helm for templated deployments.
Implementing GitOps practices using ArgoCD for consistent and declarative deployments.
Scripting in Python and Shell to automate routine tasks and reduce manual efforts.
Configuring monitoring and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog to track system health and performance.
Deploying and managing Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for messaging, and RDS for relational database services.
Supporting serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, integrated with services like S3 and RDS.
Optimizing cloud resources and cost using AWS Budgets, spot instances, and monitoring tools.
Enabling secure and compliant environments by embedding DevSecOps into the pipeline and managing IAM roles and policies.

----------------------------------------------------

I work on automating cloud infrastructure using Terraform, building reusable modules for AWS to keep things clean and scalable. I'm hands-on with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and I plug in tools like SonarQube to keep code quality in check.

I containerize apps with Docker and manage microservices on EKS using Kubernetes, with Helm charts to streamline deployments. For GitOps, I use ArgoCD to handle deployments in a more declarative and consistent way.

To cut down on manual work, I write automation scripts in Python and Shell. I also set up monitoring and alerting with tools like Prometheus, Grafana to keep systems healthy and responsive.

 I also support serverless setups using AWS Lambda, usually tying them into services like S3 and RDS.

I keep an eye on cloud costs and performance using AWS Budgets, spot instances, and monitoring tools. Security and compliance are also a big part of my work—embedding DevSecOps into pipelines and managing IAM roles and policies to keep everything safe.

day to day activities

Start the day with a daily stand-up to sync with cross-functional teams (Dev, QA, Security).
Monitor CI/CD pipelines and address any build or deployment failures.
Review and merge Git pull requests, ensuring code quality and testing checks are met.
Work on Terraform modules or Ansible playbooks to provision new cloud resources.
Manage Kubernetes deployments (e.g., scaling, config updates, rolling updates).
Use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to track system metrics and resolve alerts.
Develop or update automation scripts for repetitive tasks or infrastructure monitoring.
Help out with incidents when things go sideways — dig into root causes and fine-tune things to prevent it next time.
Conduct cost reviews, check AWS Budgets, and ensure usage aligns with targets.
Work on security improvements, such as patching, IAM policy audits, and vulnerability remediation.
